# Glass-waste-Detection

# Overview
This project leverages the YOLO v7 machine learning model for recognizing and classifying different types of glass waste. It aims to enhance recycling processes by accurately identifying glass types such as clear, brown, and green glass. Developed under the guidance of Prof. Wittmann JÃ¼rgen at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology, this project addresses crucial needs in waste management systems.

# Features
Real-time object detection and classification of glass waste.
Efficient and accurate identification of various glass types.
Potential for integration into commercial and residential waste management solutions.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
PyTorch 1.8.1 or newer
CUDA for GPU acceleration (optional)

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Naveenkumarmooram/glass-waste-recognition.git

# Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To run the glass waste recognition model : python detect.py --source <path_to_your_image_or_video>

Replace <path_to_your_image_or_video> with the actual path to the image or video you wish to analyze.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset comprising over 6000 images of glass waste, meticulously annotated to facilitate effective training of the YOLO v7 model.

# Model Training
Instructions for setting up the environment, configuring the dataset, and tuning model parameters are provided, ensuring optimal performance.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy in classifying different types of glass waste, with detailed results and observations shared.

# Future Work
Plans include exploring the integration of sensor technology for more sophisticated analysis and enhancing real-time detection capabilities for wider application.
